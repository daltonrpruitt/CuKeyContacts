# CuKeyContacts

A simple command line CRM (client/contact relationship management) tool.

Initial implementation will be (was) based on LLM output. 
I'm not sure how this should be considered ethically, 
but I really want to get something done with this, and
LLM usage seems really helpful for initial work.
